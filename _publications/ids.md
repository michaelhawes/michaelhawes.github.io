The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act provides mechanisms for educational agencies and authorities to share data with other state and local agencies for program evaluation and research, but in spite of the overall value that these integrated data repositories can provide, the legal and policy complexities associated with establishing a statewide longitudinal data system or county/municipal integrated data system often impede their creation. This publication clarified the legal framework under which an integrated data system can be established, and provided best practices for establishing them in a manner that promotes appropriate and responsible use of student data while also ensuring that privacy is properly safeguarded.
